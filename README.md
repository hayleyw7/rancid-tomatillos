# Rancid Tomatillos

This is an application to access movie details through an API. The user can access a list of movies, can select any one of them, & be provided information about that specific film.

The application is deployed and can be [accessed online here](https://rottentomatillos.surge.sh/).

## Access and use website

When the user visits the application [here](https://rottentomatillos.surge.sh/), they will be able to see a page full of movie posters. If they click a poster, they can see details about that movie. They can return to the origin posters page by clicking "BACK" on the page or the back button on their internet browser.

After returning to the poster page, they can use the forward button on their browser to return to the previous movie information page, or they can click a new movie poster to see that movie information page instead.

Each page has a unique URL that can be bookmarked and/or manually typed in the address bar.
